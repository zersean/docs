# Faucets

## Testnet

### Sepolia

The [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) provides testnet ETH for all OP Chains, including Fraxtal.

### Holesky

Currently, we do not have any active testnet faucets. However, you may use one of several [Holesky faucets](https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky) and then bridge the testnet ETH to Fraxtal.
