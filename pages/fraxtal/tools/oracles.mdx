# Oracles

## API3

[API3](https://api3.org) is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way.
API3 is building secure [first-party oracles](https://docs.api3.org/explore/introduction/first-party.html) and [OEV-enabled](https://docs.api3.org/explore/introduction/oracle-extractable-value.html) data feeds on Fraxtal. The data feeds are continuously updated by first-party oracles using signed data.

Check out the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/fraxtal) to access 150+ dAPIs on Fraxtal.

Unlike traditional data feeds, [OEV Network](https://docs.api3.org/explore/introduction/oracle-extractable-value.html) enables dApps using dAPIs to auction off the right to update the data feeds to searcher bots. Searcher bots can bid for price updates through the OEV Network to update the data feeds. This means data feeds will be updated more frequently, producing a more granular oracle, whilst facilitating more efficient liquidation processes for users and LPs of DeFi money markets. All value recaptured through the OEV Network is returned to the dApp.
