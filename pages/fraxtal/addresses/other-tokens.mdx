## Superchain Token List

Various ERC-20 tokens originally deployed to Ethereum also have corresponding "bridged" representations on Fraxtal.
The [Superchain Token List](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) exists to help users discover the correct bridged token addresses for each token.
